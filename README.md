# BouncingBall_Shooter

This was a add-on project off the BouncingBalls project for my gaming class.  This adds user interaction via using the mouse to 
aim and shoot at various sized targets.  Sound files are included.  The game keeps track of hits and misses and how many times each
target is hit.  Score is stored on the user's C: drive in a TXT file.
